            <p>Cheeto is a cat who likes to eat a lot and play a lot. He has an obsession with his grandpa (human) and tries to get
                outside every single day. If he isn't causing problems, he is usually hiding in a seven foot tall cat tree and
                sleeping.
            </p>
            <p>Another name for Cheeto is Chicken, because sometimes he sits very scrunched up and ends up looking like a rotisserie
                chicken. He was nicknamed this by one of his friends, and now he understands it as his own name. He is about six
                years old and still acts like a younger cat, despite being middle-aged.
            </p>

            <h2>Leo</h2>

            <img src = "images/labradoodle_leo.JPG" alt = "Tan labradoodle " style="width:400px; ">
            
            <p>
                Leo is a very hyper labradoodle who enjoys running around and meeting new people. Leo recently turned six back in
                July, and received two toys for his birthday which he has already destroyed. Leo also enjoys laying around the
                house, his favorite spots being my parents bedroom and the living room couch.
            </p>
            <p>
                Leo is a big fan of when the mailman comes because that means he will get a treat. At bedtime, Leo waits for both of
                my parents to get into bed before he goes to bed. He thinks he needs to guard them while they are both still awake.
            </p>

            <h2>Jax</h2>
            <img src="images/Jax.jpg" width="400" alt="A black and white kitten sitting down and wearing a yellow collar.">

            <p>
                Jax is a kitten, about five months old that I found this summer at a gas station while traveling to Marquette, Michigan.
                He was scared and malnourished, crying in the parking lot. I took him with me and after some healthy meals and a trip to
                the vet he is doing great!
            </p>
            <p>
                My roommates and I just recently moved and Jax has been having a hard time getting used to the large house since we were
                previously living in a small apartment. Jax is incredibly playful and loves to run around, but when he is sleepy he is
                happy to be held.
            </p>

            <p>
                Biscuit is a 2 year old shiba inu dog. Shiba inus are energetic and playful dogs. Biscuit enjoys running outside in
                circles and then laying down in the grass in the sun for hours. He also likes going for occasional swims.
            </p>
            <p>
                As energetic as Biscuit is, he also likes to relax. He loves to sleep in his dog bed and watch Netflix with his owners.
                His favorite treat is apples.
            </p>

            <h2>Leo</h2>
            <img src="images/Leo_primary_photo.jpg" width="400" alt="Guinea pig doing his best to smile for the camera">

            <p>
                Guinea pigs are a naturally energetic animal, who spend up to 20 hours a day awake. Despite being awake for long periods
                of time, they naturally hide in their habitats, and can be difficult to see in their inclosures. Guinea pigs naturally
                are social creatures that enjoy socializing with other guinea pigs, in the wild they form packs of five to ten.
            </p>
            <p>
                Leo is a half-lazy, half-lively guinea pig that either likes to run around on the floor, doing tiny hops, or likes to
                lay down in the cage for hours at a time nibbling at hay. His favorite hobby is eating, and he can tell whenever someone
                is about to give good to him by waiting at the end of the cardboard box patio he has attached to his cage.
            </p>
